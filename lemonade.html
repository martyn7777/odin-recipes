        How doesn't love a cool glass of lemonade on a hot day? Here's our easy method for perfect lemonade every time,
        with simple syrup and fresh lemon juice.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sugar (can reduce to 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1 cup water (for the simple syrup)</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 to 3 cups cold water, to dilute</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the simple syrup:
            Place the sugar and water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Stir so that the sugar dissolves
            completely and remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Juice the lemons:
            While the water is heating for the simple syrup, juice your lemons. Depending on the size of the lemons, 4
            to 6 of them should be enough for 1 cup of juice.
        </li>
        <li>Mix the lemonade:
            Pour the juice and the simple syrup sugar water into a serving pitcher. Add 2 to 3 cups of cold water and
            taste. Add more water if you would like it to be more diluted (though note that when you add ice, it will
            melt and naturally dilute the lemonade).

            If the lemonade is a little sweet for your taste, add a little more straight lemon juice to it.
        </li>
        <li>Chill and serve:
            Refrigerate 30 to 40 minutes.

            Serve with ice and sliced lemons.
        </li>
    </ol>
