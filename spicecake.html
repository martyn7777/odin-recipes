    <h1>Kim's Buttermilk Spice Cake</h1>
    <img src="img/spicecake" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This spice cake was inspired by a recipe from one of my mom's old cookbooks. It was my great-grandpa's favorite
        cake, and I used to make it for him all the time. It's a simple cake that's not too sweet, and has a rather
        strong spice flavor. Err on the side of underbaking the cake rather than overbaking, or it'll be dry.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Cake</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups buttermilk, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Cream Cheese Frosting</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice in a bowl
            until well combined.</li>
        <li>Cream together butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and
            fluffy. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract. Add in half of
            the flour mixture, and stir until just combined. Pour in buttermilk, and mix until just combined. Add in
            remaining flour mixture and mix until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan and spread into an
            even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the middle of the cake springs back lightly when touched, 40 to 45 minutes.
            Remove from the oven and allow the cake to cool completely before frosting.</li>
        <li>For the frosting, cream butter in a large bowl until smooth. Add cream cheese and beat until thoroughly
            combined. Mix in confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, and beat until smooth after each addition. Mix in
            vanilla and salt. Add in heavy cream and beat until frosting is smooth, about 2 minutes. Frost cooled cake
            as desired.</li>
    </ol>
